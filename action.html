        Many ages in the past, humanity faced near-extinction as monstrous humanoid beings known as Titans ruthlessly slaughtered them. Fearing for their lives, humans sought refuge behind colossal concentric walls. What heightened the terror of these giants was not just their hunger for human flesh, but a seemingly sadistic pleasure derived from it. In a bid for survival, the remnants of humanity took shelter within defensive barriers, enjoying a century of peace without encountering any Titans. However, this fragile tranquility is shattered when a colossal Titan breaches the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the battle for survival against these man-eating monsters.

        After experiencing a devastating personal loss at the hands of the invading Titans, Eren Yeager commits himself to their extermination. He enlists in the Survey Corps, an elite military unit tasked with confronting the merciless Titans beyond the protective walls. Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and childhood friend Armin Arlert, becomes part of the brutal war against the Titans, racing against time to uncover a method to defeat them before the last remaining walls are breached.
