        From a young age, Thorfinn was immersed in tales from seasoned sailors who spoke of the legendary land, Vinland, a warm and fertile haven where conflict was nonexistent—a stark contrast to the icy village in Iceland where he was born and his current life as a mercenary, entrenched in war. While his father once conveyed the notion that "You have no enemies, nobody does. There is nobody who it's okay to hurt," Thorfinn learned over time that this idealistic view was far from reality.
        <br>
        The ongoing war between England and the Danes intensifies with each passing year, and death becomes a routine occurrence. Viking mercenaries revel in the chaos, eager to align themselves with either side, thereby tipping the balance of power and seizing any spoils that come their way. Amidst the turmoil, Thorfinn is driven by the need for vengeance against Askeladd, the man who murdered his father. In this era dominated by war and death, it appears that the only semblance of paradise for the vikings lies in the chaos they thrive upon.
