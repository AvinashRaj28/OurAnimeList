        <p>Engaging in unfounded supernatural activities with the Occult Club, high school student Yuuji Itadori divides his time between the clubroom and the hospital, where he cares for his ailing grandfather. However, his laid-back routine takes an unexpected turn when he unintentionally comes across a cursed object. This chance encounter sets off a series of paranormal events, propelling Yuuji into the realm of Curses—sinister entities born from human malevolence and negativity. By ingesting the object, which is later revealed to be a finger belonging to <strong>Sukuna Ryoumen</strong>, the King of Curses, Yuuji becomes entangled in a world he never knew existed. <br>
        As he grapples with his newfound abilities, Yuuji witnesses the menace that Curses pose to society. Guided to the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School, he embarks on an irreversible journey as a Jujutsu sorcerer, fully immersed in a path that challenges him with the responsibility of combating these supernatural threats</p>
