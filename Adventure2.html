        A decade ago, an otherworldly phenomenon called "the Gate" materialized, linking the real world to a realm filled with magic and monsters. In response to the threat posed by these malevolent creatures, regular individuals were endowed with superhuman abilities and became known as "Hunters." Sung Jin-Woo, a twenty-year-old Hunter, holds the dubious title of the "World's Weakest" due to his meager powers, even falling below the standards of an E-Rank. Despite this, he tirelessly engages in monster hunting within low-rank Gates to cover the medical expenses for his ailing mother.
        <br>
        Jin-Woo's bleak existence takes an unexpected turn when, following a mission gone awry where he believes he is the lone survivor destined for death, he awakens in a hospital three days later. To his surprise, a mysterious screen appears before him, presenting a "Quest Log" that mandates Jin-Woo to undergo an incredibly demanding training regimen or face suitable consequences. Initially hesitant due to the arduous nature of the quest, Jin-Woo soon discovers that it might hold the key to transforming him into one of the world's most formidable Hunters.
