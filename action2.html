        <p>Since his father's demise, Tanjirou Kamado has shouldered the responsibility of providing for his family. Despite residing in poverty on a secluded mountain, the Kamado family manages to lead a relatively peaceful and content life. One fateful day, Tanjirou ventures down to the nearby village to earn some money by selling charcoal. However, as night descends on his way back, he seeks refuge in the home of a peculiar man who warns him about flesh-eating demons that roam the woods after dark.
        <br>    
        Upon returning home the next day, Tanjirou is met with a horrifying scene—his entire family has been brutally slaughtered. To make matters worse, his only surviving sibling, Nezuko, has been transformed into a bloodthirsty demon. Overwhelmed by anger and resentment, Tanjirou vows to avenge his family and stand by his transformed sister. Teaming up with the enigmatic group known as the Demon Slayer Corps, Tanjirou is determined to eliminate the demons and safeguard the remnants of his sister's humanity at any cost.</p>
