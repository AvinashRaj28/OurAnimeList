        In this enchanted realm, individuals possessing magical prowess are easily distinguished by a unique mark on their faces. Those devoid of magical abilities face swift eradication to preserve the magical cohesion of society. Yet, nestled deep within a forest, exists an anomaly named <strong>Mash Burnedead</strong>, a boy who defies convention. Engaged in weightlifting with one arm and savoring a cream puff with the other, Mash, though lacking magical gifts, exhibits superhuman strength. Leading a tranquil life with his father, they live in seclusion, distanced from societal norms.
        <br>
        Mash's tranquility is disrupted when authorities uncover his absence of magical powers. Presented with an ultimatum, he must either vie for the title of "Divine Visionary," compelling acceptance from all, or endure perpetual persecution. In a bid to safeguard his family, Mash enrolls in the esteemed Easton Magic Academy, reserved for the most exceptional and talented students. Now, he must surmount his deficiencies as a non-magical being and outshine his peers, relying solely on his physical prowess.
