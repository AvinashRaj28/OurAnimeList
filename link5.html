        <p>Following a disastrous alchemical experiment at the Elric residence, brothers Edward and Alphonse find themselves in a dire new reality. Despite the alchemical taboo against human transmutation, the siblings defy the principle in a misguided attempt to resurrect their deceased mother. The outcome is a devastating personal tragedy: Alphonse loses his physical form, and Edward sacrifices a leg, later followed by an arm, to bind Alphonse's soul to a massive suit of armor.

        Their neighbor Pinako Rockbell and her granddaughter Winry come to their rescue.

After extensive training, the Elric brothers embark on a journey to recover their original bodies by seeking the Philosopher's Stone—an influential gem that defies the conventional laws of Equivalent Exchange.
