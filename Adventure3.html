        Throughout their decade-long mission to overcome the Demon King, the hero's party—consisting of Himmel, the priest Heiter, the dwarf warrior Eisen, and the elven mage Frieren—develop deep connections during their adventures and battles, forming unforgettable memories for most members.
        <br>
        Nevertheless, for Frieren, the time spent with her comrades represents only a fraction of her millennia-long life. After the party disbands following their triumph, Frieren nonchalantly resumes her "usual" routine of collecting spells across the continent. Due to her unique perception of time, she appears to lack strong emotions toward the experiences she underwent.
        <br>
        Over the passing years, Frieren gradually recognizes the profound impact the days in the hero's party had on her. Witnessing the deaths of two former companions, she starts regretting having taken their presence for granted and resolves to gain a deeper understanding of humans, aiming to form genuine personal connections. Although the story of that once-memorable journey has concluded, a new narrative is poised to unfold.
