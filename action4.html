            Following a disastrous alchemical experiment at the Elric residence, brothers Edward and Alphonse find themselves in a dire new reality. Despite the alchemical taboo against human transmutation, the siblings defy the principle in a misguided attempt to resurrect their deceased mother. The outcome is a devastating personal tragedy: Alphonse loses his physical form, and Edward sacrifices a leg, later followed by an arm, to bind Alphonse's soul to a massive suit of armor.

        Their neighbor Pinako Rockbell and her granddaughter Winry come to their rescue. Winry, recognized as a prodigy in bio-mechanical engineering, constructs automail, a resilient and versatile metal used in robotics and combat armor, to create prosthetic limbs for Edward. After extensive training, the Elric brothers embark on a journey to recover their original bodies by seeking the Philosopher's Stone—an influential gem that defies the conventional laws of Equivalent Exchange.
       
        As Edward gains notoriety as the "Fullmetal" alchemist, the brothers become entangled in a deepening conspiracy that poses a threat to the world's destiny.
